    <p>I'm a web developer working at Limewheel Creative in British Columbia, Canada.</p>
    <p>For convenience, my web life is open to the public. This website holds more information about me than you'll ever want to know.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding away at my Logitech keyboard, I can usually be found in a game of Unreal Tournament or something. I enjoy sunny days, relaxing behind a movie or TV show, and chilling in IRC chat rooms.</p>
    <p>My operating system of choice is OS X, but corporate monopoly forces me to switch to Windows 7 to actually run games >.<</p>
    <p>I'm fluent in 5 programming languages, 3 formatting languages, and 2 query languages.</p>
